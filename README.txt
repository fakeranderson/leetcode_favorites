These are some of the problems that I enjoyed the most from leetcode.com's problems list.
If not specified, compile line is:
 g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror [filaname].cpp -std=c++1y -o [output_filename] 
Folder names are the problem numbers

Several are saved as non-compilable classes because they were copied directly from my leetcode submission.
